## Introduction to Microsoft Azure IoT Suite

#### What is Microsoft Azure IoT suite?
Please watch this introductory video which describes Azure IoT Suite at a high level, [here](https://youtu.be/L8xjSjxaaVA)

#### Elements of Azure IoT Suite

The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite offers solutions to three key areas. The Azure IoT suite connects and scales with efficiency, analyzes and acts on new data, and integrates and transforms business processes.

1. Connect and Scale with Efficiency
  * Preconfigured Solutions
  * SDK
  * Connect and Control
2. Analyze and act on new data
  * Event processing
  * Predictive analytics
  * Data visualization
3. Integrate and transform business processes
  * Workflow integration
  * Push and broadcast notifications
  * ID and access management

The preconfigured solution offer a startup to common IoT scenario requirements. Heterogenous-agent libraries, documentation, and SDKs allow for OS selection and cross-platform Multilanguage support.

Connect and control devices easily handling device authentication and secure two-way communication. Analyze and act on new data. You can set thresholds, alert limits, and values, and alarms while processing data.

You can implement predictive analytics and algorithms across historical and real-time data for a variety of purposes. Data visualization provides dashboards, where a user can make reports for business decision-makers.

Integrate and transport or integrate and transform business processes. A user can integrate alarms, real-time processes, and elevate attention within new or existing line of business applications, broadcast notifications and commands to devices or personnel.

A user can utilize geographic or other custom features to target audiences,
make dashboards and data available,
but control security and access to device's thresholds and alert configurations.

#### Connect and Scale with efficiency

###### Preconfigured Solutions
1. Remote Monitoring

  Implementation of an end-to-end monitoring solution for machines running in remote location

2. Predictive Maintenance

  Integrates real-time device telemetry collection with a predictive model generated using Azure  Machine Learning

###### SDK

_Supports various languages, protocols, and operating systems_

1. C Libraries Supported
  * Debian Linux (v 7.5) HTTPS, AMQP, MQTT
  * Fedora Linux (v 20) HTTPS, AMPQ, MQTT
  * mbed OS (v 2.0) HTTPS, AMQP
  * Ubuntu Linux (v 14.04) HTTPS, AMQP, MQTT
  * Windows Desktop (7,8,10) HTTPS, AMQP, MQTT
  * Yocto Linux (v 2.1) HTTPS, AMQP

2. Operating Systems Supported
  * Ddebian Linux (v 7.5)
  * Fedora Linux (v 20)
  * mbed OS (v 2.0)
  * Raspbian Linux (v 3.18)
  * Ubuntu Linux (v 14.04)
  * Windows Desktop (7,8,10)
  * Windows IoT Core (v 10)
  * Windows Server (v 2012 R2)
  * Yocto Linux (v 2.1)

###### Connect and Control

_Azure IoT Hub is a solution for connect and control, it offers massive scalability_

* Supports:
  * up to 10 million devices per instance
  * Hyper scale IoT solution
  * Cloud-scale messaging
  * Two-way communication
  * Device health telemetry
  * Per-device authentication
  * Multi-protocol Support

Secure two-way communication and command control to a device level can be achieved through IoT Hub

Device Health telemetry can be displayed through the IoT Hub portal in the preconfigured solution, offering real-time insights into the performance of a device.

Communication errors and faulty assets can be identified and flagged for attention or simply removed from the system.

Tighten security through per-device ID and credential authentication is provided. IoT Hub natively supports MTQP and HTTPS protocols, and it is designed to support custom protocols where required

#### Analyze and act on new Data

###### Event processing

_Azure Stream Analytics is the event processing solution_

* Supports:
  * Real time event processing of massive Data
  * Flag rules/events for attention
  * Build rules with simple SQL syntax

It offers the processing, analytics, and handling of massive amounts of real-time data. It is exposed in the preconfigured solution for the settings of rules and alarms. It then runs these rules as it processes the incoming data, ingestion, and flags what needs to be escalated for attention.

###### Predictive Analytics

_Azure Machine Learning is the predictive analytics solution_

* Machine Learning Studio
* Machine Learning API service

A user can use Machine Learning Studio to create models using a simple drag and drop decision tree method. When the model is adequate, it can be deployed quickly to the Machine Learning API service. The machine learning API service generates the model as a URL that can be called from any business end point.

###### Data Visualization

_Power BI is the data visualization solution_

* Cloud based dashboard and analytics tool
* Pre-built dashboards
* Intuitive, natural language query tool
* Secure and live communication with data sources

Power BI is a cloud-based dashboard and analytics tool. A user can quickly develop deep dive dashboards using pre-built dashboards. Data can be easily called and analyzed within a dashboard. Additionally, a user can dive deeper and perform queries with native language search functions. Power BI provides secure access of data, as well as secure and live communication with data sources.  

#### Integrate and transform business processes

###### Workflow Integration

_Logic Apps is the workflow integration solution_

* Enables integration with business systems

Workflows and connections can be integrated and highly automated with Logic Apps

###### Push & Broadcast Notifications

_Notification Hubs is the pushing broadcast notification solution_

* Broadcast notifications to any backend

A user can broadcast to all or some of his/her devices using Notification Hubs.

###### ID & Access Management

_Azure Active Directory is ID & Access Management solution_

* Sharing and access control

A user can simply manage user access and control what functions and dashboards certain users can access.
