#### What is Microsoft Azure?
* A set of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications
* Provides integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace to support development of simple mobile apps to internet-scale solutions
* Microsoft claims that Azure is the only consistent hybrid cloud
  * A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment that uses a mix of on-premises private cloud, and third-party public cloud services; with orchestration between the two platforms
  * The on-premises private cloud is usually managed by the user, and the public cloud is typically managed by a third party
  * A consistent hybrid cloud model allows users to work with both operational and analytical data
